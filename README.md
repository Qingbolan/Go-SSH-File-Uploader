# Go SSH File Uploader

Go SSH File Uploader is a robust, high-performance file transfer application written entirely in Go. It leverages the power and simplicity of Go to provide a seamless, cross-platform solution for secure file uploads via SSH.

## Features

- **Pure Go implementation**: Benefit from Go's performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Dual-pane file explorer**: Navigate local and remote file systems side by side.
- **Recursive folder upload**: Easily upload entire directories and their contents.
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress bar for file uploads.
- **Secure connections**: Uses SSH for secure file transfers.
- **User-friendly interface**: Built with tview for a responsive terminal UI.

4. Press Enter on a local file or folder to upload it to the current remote directory.
5. The status bar at the bottom will show the progress and any error messages.

## Vision and Long-term Goals

Our vision for Go SSH File Uploader extends far beyond its current capabilities. We aim to create a comprehensive, enterprise-grade file management and transfer solution. Here are some of our ambitious long-term goals:

1. **Cloud Integration**: Seamless integration with major cloud storage providers (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).
2. **Advanced Transfer Protocols**: Support for additional protocols like SFTP, FTP/FTPS, and rsync.
3. **Distributed File Transfer**: Implement peer-to-peer file sharing capabilities for efficient large file transfers.
4. **AI-Powered File Management**: Integrate machine learning algorithms for intelligent file organization and search.
5. **Blockchain-Based File Verification**: Implement a blockchain solution for file integrity and authenticity verification.
6. **Cross-Platform GUI**: Develop a cross-platform GUI using frameworks like Electron or Qt.
7. **Mobile App**: Create companion mobile apps for remote file management and transfer.
8. **Enterprise Features**: Implement advanced features like role-based access control, audit logging, and compliance reporting.
9. **Scriptable Automation**: Develop a powerful scripting interface for automated file operations and transfers.
10. **Global File System**: Work towards creating a distributed, global file system that seamlessly integrates local and remote storage.

We believe these goals will push the boundaries of what's possible in file management and transfer, leveraging the full potential of Go's performance and concurrency features.
